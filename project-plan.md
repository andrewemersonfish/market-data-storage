# Options Flow Analysis Project Plan

---

## 1. High-Level Overview
- **Project Goal**: Build a robust system to detect unusual options order flow that precedes significant price movements.
- **Key Challenges**:
  1. Managing and analyzing large volumes of data (multi-year, multi-timescale).
  2. Ensuring real-time or near real-time detection with low latency.
  3. Maintaining statistical and analytical rigor for “unusual” pattern detection.
- **Data Location**: 
  - Backblaze B2 (S3-compatible) holding trade-level, minute-level, and daily-level US options data (3 years).

## 2. Phase Breakdown

### 2.1 Phase 1: Data Infrastructure + Research & Analysis

#### 2.1.1 Data Ingestion, Modeling, and Quality Framework

- **Objectives**  
  - Implement data ingestion scripts in Python to pull data from Backblaze B2 into a **data lake**.
  - Define a scalable storage structure for trade-level, minute-level, and daily aggregates.
  - Develop data validation checks and automated quality assurance.

- **Key Steps**
  1. **Data Ingestion**  
     - Use **custom Python scripts** (e.g., `boto3`-like libraries for S3-compatible endpoints) to download or stream data.  
     - Organize data in partitioned folders by date → symbol (or symbol → date), depending on query patterns.

  2. **Data Lake Architecture**  
     - Create a **“raw” layer** with minimal transformations.  
     - Create a **“curated” layer** with standardized schemas, cleaned fields, and additional metadata if needed (e.g., partitioned by symbol/date).

  3. **Data Validation & Quality**  
     - Use **Great Expectations** or **Deequ** in Python for automated checks (e.g., valid price ranges, non-null fields, consistent timestamps).
     - Log any anomalies or suspicious gaps for manual review.

  4. **Python Native Scaling**  
     - Consider **Dask** or `multiprocessing` for parallelizing ingestion and transformation tasks.  
     - Evaluate chunk sizes to avoid memory bottlenecks.

#### 2.1.2 Exploratory Research & Market Analysis

- **Objectives**  
  - Establish baseline market behavior for options across different regimes.  
  - Define “significant price moves” using **both** standard deviation and percentile thresholds.  
  - Identify initial “unusual flow” criteria (simple volume/volatility anomalies).

- **Key Steps**
  1. **Market Regime Detection**  
     - Use daily returns and volatilities to cluster (e.g., K-means, HDBSCAN) into typical vs. high-vol regimes.
     - Try GARCH or HMM models if deeper volatility/regime analysis is required.

  2. **Significance Thresholds**  
     - **Standard Deviation**: Movement > X std dev from mean.  
     - **Percentile**: Movement in top X% of historical distribution.  
     - Compare both approaches on a subset to see which best aligns with actual price fluctuations.

  3. **Order Flow Analysis (Preliminary)**  
     - Correlate large trades, order imbalances, or net deltas with subsequent price action.
     - Investigate time-of-day effects (e.g., open vs. close) to see if anomalies cluster.

  4. **Prototype Simple Anomaly Detection**  
     - Implement a minimal backtest on a sample dataset to see if basic anomalies (spikes in volume/OI) consistently predict moves.

### 2.2 Phase 3: System Implementation

#### 2.2.1 Batch & Near Real-Time Processing

- **Batch Pipeline**  
  - **Custom Python Scripts** to run on a schedule (e.g., cron jobs, Airflow DAGs) that:  
    - Pull new data from Backblaze B2  
    - Transform and validate data  
    - Load curated data into the data lake tables
  - Use **Dask** to parallelize transformations if needed.

- **Real-Time Pipeline (Future)**  
  - Set up a **WebSocket** endpoint to receive trade-level data in real time.  
  - Possibly store or buffer these trades in an in-memory store (Redis, Kafka) before streaming to the detection engine.

#### 2.2.2 Unusual Order Flow Detection

1. **Anomaly Detection Engine**  
   - Implement two parallel pipelines:
     - **Classical ML**: Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor  
     - **Deep Learning**: Autoencoders or LSTM-based anomaly detection for sequence/time-series patterns
   - Log both types of anomaly signals for comparison and offline evaluation.

2. **Signal Generation & Validation**  
   - Each anomaly detection pipeline outputs a signal with a confidence score.  
   - Optionally, filter signals by market regime (to reduce false positives in high-volatility periods).

3. **Performance Monitoring & Reporting**  
   - Track ingestion-to-detection latency, CPU/memory usage, and queue sizes.  
   - Use **Grafana + Prometheus** or a similar stack (DataDog, ELK) for real-time monitoring dashboards and alerts.

#### 2.2.3 Backtesting & Deployment

1. **Backtesting Framework**  
   - Implement a rolling window approach to validate how anomaly signals correlate with future price moves.  
   - Collect metrics: precision, recall, false positive rate, potential PnL if applying a hypothetical trading strategy.

2. **Containerization**  
   - Use **Docker** to package Python scripts and services.  
   - For orchestration, either:
     - **Basic Docker Compose** if you prefer simpler local orchestration.  
     - **Kubernetes** (K8s) if you decide to scale across multiple nodes or want to learn/implement more robust orchestration.

3. **Deployment Flow**  
   - Optionally integrate an MLOps tool (e.g., MLflow) to track different versions of detection algorithms.  
   - Automate continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to rebuild Docker images upon code updates.

### 2.3 Phase 4: Optimization & Refinement

1. **System Performance Tuning**  
   - Load-test the ingestion and detection pipelines using historical data at scale.  
   - Profile memory, CPU usage, and I/O throughput. Adjust Dask cluster size or container resources as needed.

2. **Signal Quality & Reduction of False Positives**  
   - Gather feedback from historical runs (true positives vs. false positives).  
   - Refine thresholds, retrain models with more nuanced features (e.g., implied volatility surface, market sentiment data if available).

3. **Documentation & Monitoring**  
   - Document final pipeline architecture, data schemas, and detection algorithms.  
   - Enhance monitoring for model drift—especially important if the market environment changes abruptly (e.g., black swan events).

## 3. Success Metrics & Validation

1. **Signal Performance**  
   - Precision, recall, and F1 for unusual-order detections.  
   - % of signals leading to significant price moves (based on std dev or percentile thresholds).

2. **System Performance**  
   - **Latency**: Time from ingestion to signal generation.  
   - **Throughput**: Number of trades processed per second or average daily data ingestion rate.

3. **False Positive Rate (FPR)**  
   - Ratio of signals that do **not** lead to meaningful price changes.

4. **Scalability**  
   - Ability to handle 2–3x current trade volumes or peak loads (e.g., market open).

---

## 4. Risk Considerations & Mitigations

1. **Data Quality & Continuity**  
   - **Mitigation**: Daily validation checks; fallback to older snapshots if fresh data is incomplete.

2. **Market Regime Shifts**  
   - **Mitigation**: Implement drift detection for anomaly detection models. Retrain or revert to simpler heuristics if performance degrades.

3. **Infrastructure Overload**  
   - **Mitigation**: Use Docker/Kubernetes autoscaling features (horizontal pod autoscaling) if loads spike, or scale Dask workers dynamically.

4. **False Positives**  
   - **Mitigation**: Tiered confidence (medium vs. high confidence signals). Possibly a manual review queue for extremely high-risk signals.

5. **Regulatory Compliance**  
   - **Mitigation**: Maintain logs for data ingestion, model outputs, and any downstream usage for a set retention period. Keep an audit trail of code changes and data transformations.

## 5. Parallel Workstreams for Efficiency

1. **Data Infrastructure & Early Analysis**  
   - Stand up the data lake while simultaneously running exploratory analysis on subsets of data.  
   - Early findings can guide the design of the curated schema and partitioning strategy.

2. **Backtesting Environment**  
   - Develop a simple backtest harness to quickly evaluate new anomaly detection models.  
   - Integrate with a library (e.g., `backtrader` in Python) or write a custom system for specialized metrics.

3. **Monitoring & Logging**  
   - Set up logging (e.g., Python `logging`, ELK stack) and monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana) from the start to capture usage stats and errors from early prototypes.

4. **Prototype WebSocket Integration**  
   - Start designing how real-time data from the WebSocket will flow into your data pipeline, but focus on a stable batch pipeline first.  
   - Plan how your anomaly detection engine will be adapted to handle “live” streaming data.
